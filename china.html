            China, Chinese (Pinyin) Zhonghua or (Wade-Giles romanization) Chung-hua, also spelled (Pinyin) Zhongguo or
            (Wade-Giles romanization) Chung-kuo, officially People’s Republic of China or Chinese (Pinyin) Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo or
             Wade-Giles romanization) Chung-hua Jen-min Kung-ho-kuo, country of East Asia. It is the largest of all Asian countries and
             has the largest population of any country in the world. Occupying nearly the entire East Asian landmass, it covers 
             approximately one-fourteenth of the land area of Earth. Among the major countries of the world, China is surpassed in
             area by only Russia and Canada, and it is almost as large as the whole of Europe.

            China has 33 administrative units directly under the central government; these consist of 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions,
            4 municipalities (Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin), and 2 special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau). 
            The island province of Taiwan, which has been under separate administration since 1949, is discussed in the article Taiwan.
            Beijing (Peking), the capital of the People’s Republic, is also the cultural, economic, and communications centre of the 
            country. Shanghai is the main industrial city; Hong Kong is the leading commercial centre and port.

            Within China’s boundaries exists a highly diverse and complex country. Its topography encompasses the highest and one of
            the lowest places on Earth, and its relief varies from nearly impenetrable mountainous terrain to vast coastal lowlands. 
            Its climate ranges from extremely dry, desertlike conditions in the northwest to tropical monsoon in the southeast, and 
            China has the greatest contrast in temperature between its northern and southern borders of any country in the world.
